	<p>The '80s would bring about more iconic series for western audiences. Thanks to improvements in home video, higher quality shows would be released on VHS. "Fansubs" (recordings of original anime releases that would later be fan subtitled) would also become more widely available, which would allow fans to watch their favorite shows that may not have been released in the U.S.</p>
	<p>The most popular show during this era was known as Robotech, which was a combination of three different shows. Super Dimension Fortress Macross, Super Dimension Cavalry Southern Cross, and Genesis Clumber Mospeada. A U.S. company known as Harmony Gold combined these three shows together and rebranded them as Robotech. It was well-received for its adult themes and complex characters and was praised for showing that anime can also be for adults.</p>

	<p>Some other shows that were released are known as mecha and sentai anime such as Voltron: Defender of the Universe, which would inspire other shows like Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers. This genre would be one of the more influential for future anime and tv shows. The biggest revolution would be full-length feature films. At this time anime films were becoming more popular in Japan and some would be imported for American audiences. One of these movies featured was Hayao Miyazaki's Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind in released in 1984 (the U.S. release was significantly edited and dubbed Warriors of the Wind). The most influential film was Katsuhiro Otomo's Akira released in 1988. It wasn't much of a success in Japan but it would be a huge hit in the U.S. This was another anime that proved animation could be catered for an adult audience with its dark and traumatizing themes. Akira would end up becoming a worldwide phenomenon and played a major role in anime's rise in the U.S. Modern media from all around the world still references Akira.</p>
